This game makes use of the Open Trivia Database API to generate questions and multiple choice answers. This is a free api and I have provided a link to the documentation in the description.

## Objectives

5. After user answers the question display if the answer was correct or incorrect
6. Have the game keep track of the total correct answers and total incorrect answers.
7. Allow user to start the game again without refreshing the browser.
